Description
===========

The idea is to leave gate remote at home connected to power and Arduino with a WiFi shield on.
Next using geofencing on iPhone (or any other mobile device) discover your location 
and trigger gate opening when youryou approach home or office. 
This can be later extended to giving access to your friends, when they arrive gate
will be open for them. 

Project consists of several parts: 
1. Arduino 
2. WiFi shield for Arduino 
3. Webserver
4. iPhone
